# Credit-card
Case study
Analyzing an affinity credit card (special card only available to members of a specific group). Think of it like this - the credit card company is like Citibank and the affiliated group is a company like Indian Oil or Barista. The affiliated group has to pay some fees to credit card company (because the credit card company is providing this service to the group)
 
Facts:
) average card balance is Rs 1000
) each card has an interest rate of 15%
) membership fee is Rs 20 per card
) loss rate is 3% (NOTE: what are the interpretations of this ? state your assumption CLEARLY when solving  )
) Rs 25 operating cost per card
) Rs 10 affiliation fee per card (cost to the group organization itself, so that their members get this awesome card program)
) 6.5% cost of funds (that credit card company must pay to the bank where it gets money)
) bill/statement is issued on 1st of every month
) credit-free period = 15 days from the bill/statement issue date.
